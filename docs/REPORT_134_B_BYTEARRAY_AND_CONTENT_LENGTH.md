# Completion Report — CC_SPEC_134_B_BYTEARRAY_AND_CONTENT_LENGTH

**Session:** 134
**Date:** March 16, 2026
**Spec:** CC_SPEC_134_B_BYTEARRAY_AND_CONTENT_LENGTH.md

---

## Section 1 — Overview

Two image download functions in `prompts/tasks.py` used `content = b''` with
`content += chunk` for streaming downloads. This pattern creates a new `bytes`
object on every iteration, resulting in O(n^2) memory allocations for large files.
Additionally, `_download_source_image` (added in Session 132 for the SRC-6 feature)
lacked the `Content-Length` header pre-check that `_download_and_encode_image` already
had, meaning oversized files would not be rejected until they were partially downloaded.

This spec fixes both issues with minimal, non-breaking changes.

## Section 2 — Expectations

| Criterion | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| `_download_and_encode_image` uses `bytearray()` + `.extend()` | ✅ Met |
| `_download_source_image` uses `bytearray()` + `.extend()` | ✅ Met |
| `_download_source_image` has Content-Length pre-check | ✅ Met |
| `bytes(content)` returned where callers expect `bytes` | ✅ Met |
| `base64.b64encode()` still works with `bytearray` | ✅ Met — accepts any bytes-like |
| 1 new test added | ✅ Met |

## Section 3 — Changes Made

### prompts/tasks.py
- Line 996: `content = b''` → `content = bytearray()`
- Line 998: `content += chunk` → `content.extend(chunk)`
- Line 1003: `base64.b64encode(content)` unchanged (accepts bytearray natively)
- Lines 3057–3061: Added Content-Length pre-check matching `_download_and_encode_image`
  pattern (lines 973–977). Logs `[SRC-6] Source image too large (Content-Length)`.
- Line 3062: `content = b''` → `content = bytearray()`
- Line 3064: `content += chunk` → `content.extend(chunk)`
- Line 3068: `return content` → `return bytes(content)` (callers expect `bytes`)

### prompts/tests/test_src6_source_image_upload.py
- Lines 236–253: New test `test_content_length_precheck_rejects_large_source_image`.
  Mocks response with `content-length` > `MAX_IMAGE_SIZE`, asserts `None` return
  and verifies `iter_content` was never called (early rejection).

## Section 4 — Issues Encountered and Resolved

No issues encountered during implementation.

---

## Section 5 — Remaining Issues

No remaining issues. All spec objectives met.

---

## Section 6 — Concerns and Areas for Improvement

**Concern:** `int(content_length)` in both functions has no `try/except` for
malformed headers. If a server returns `content-length: garbage`, `ValueError`
is raised and caught by the outer `except Exception` handler.
**Impact:** Safe — returns `None` and logs. But the failure message is opaque.
**Recommended action:** Pre-existing pattern in both functions. No change needed
unless a more specific error message is desired.

## Section 7 — Agent Ratings

| Round | Agent | Score | Key Findings | Acted On? |
|-------|-------|-------|--------------|-----------|
| 1 | @django-pro | 10/10 | All verification points confirmed; asymmetric return types correct | N/A — no issues |
| 1 | @code-reviewer | 9/10 | Both functions updated; Content-Length pattern matches; test is meaningful | N/A — no issues |
| **Average** | | **9.5/10** | | **Pass ≥ 8.0** |

---

## Section 8 — Recommended Additional Agents

All relevant agents were included. No additional agents would have added material
value for this spec. A @performance-engineer could have validated the O(n^2) → O(n)
claim, but the improvement is well-established in Python documentation.

---

## Section 9 — How to Test

**Automated:**
```bash
python manage.py test prompts.tests.test_src6_source_image_upload
# Expected: 12 tests, 0 failures

python manage.py test
# Expected: 1193 tests, 0 failures, 12 skipped
```

## Section 10 — Commits

*(To be filled after full suite passes)*

---

## Section 11 — What to Work on Next

No immediate follow-up required. Both download functions are now consistent in their
`bytearray` usage and Content-Length pre-check behavior.

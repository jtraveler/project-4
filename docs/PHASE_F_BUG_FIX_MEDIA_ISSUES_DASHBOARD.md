# Phase F Bug Fix: Media Issues Dashboard - Soft Delete Filter

**Date:** October 31, 2025
**Severity:** Medium (Shows deleted items, confuses admin)
**Fix Complexity:** Trivial (1 line addition)
**Testing:** 2 manual tests required
**Status:** Ready to implement

---

## Issue Summary

### The Problem
The `media_issues_dashboard` view shows prompts with missing media, but includes soft-deleted prompts that should be in the trash bin.

### Symptoms
1. **Symptom 1:** Soft-deleted prompts appear in the media issues table
2. **Symptom 2:** After bulk deleting items, they still appear in the list until page refresh
3. **User Confusion:** "I deleted this, why is it still here?"

### Root Cause
Missing `deleted_at__isnull=True` filter in the queryset.

---

## Current Code (Broken)

**File:** `/prompts/views.py`
**Function:** `media_issues_dashboard(request)`
**Lines:** ~1900-1920 (approximate)

```python
def media_issues_dashboard(request):
    """Dashboard showing all prompts with media issues."""
    from django.db.models import Q
    from django.contrib.admin.sites import site as admin_site

    no_media = Prompt.all_objects.filter(
        Q(featured_image__isnull=True) | Q(featured_image='')
    )  # ❌ BUG: Missing deleted_at filter

    published = no_media.filter(status=1)
    drafts = no_media.filter(status=0)

    # ... rest of function
```

---

## Fixed Code

```python
def media_issues_dashboard(request):
    """Dashboard showing all prompts with media issues."""
    from django.db.models import Q
    from django.contrib.admin.sites import site as admin_site

    no_media = Prompt.all_objects.filter(
        Q(featured_image__isnull=True) | Q(featured_image=''),
        deleted_at__isnull=True  # ✅ ADD THIS LINE
    )

    published = no_media.filter(status=1)
    drafts = no_media.filter(status=0)

    # ... rest of function
```

---

## What Changed

### Exact Diff
```diff
  def media_issues_dashboard(request):
      """Dashboard showing all prompts with media issues."""
      from django.db.models import Q
      from django.contrib.admin.sites import site as admin_site

      no_media = Prompt.all_objects.filter(
          Q(featured_image__isnull=True) | Q(featured_image=''),
+         deleted_at__isnull=True
      )
```

### Why This Fix Works

**Before:**
- Uses `Prompt.all_objects` → includes soft-deleted items
- No filter for `deleted_at` → doesn't exclude trash
- Result: Soft-deleted prompts appear in the table

**After:**
- Uses `Prompt.all_objects` → includes soft-deleted items
- Adds `deleted_at__isnull=True` → excludes soft-deleted
- Result: Only ACTIVE prompts appear in the table

---

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Locate the Code
```bash
# Search for the function in prompts/views.py
grep -n "def media_issues_dashboard" prompts/views.py
```

### Step 2: Make the Edit
Add `deleted_at__isnull=True,` to the filter call:

**Before:**
```python
no_media = Prompt.all_objects.filter(
    Q(featured_image__isnull=True) | Q(featured_image='')
)
```

**After:**
```python
no_media = Prompt.all_objects.filter(
    Q(featured_image__isnull=True) | Q(featured_image=''),
    deleted_at__isnull=True
)
```

### Step 3: Test the Fix

#### Test 1: Verify Deleted Items Are Excluded

```python
# Django shell test
python manage.py shell

# Create a test prompt
from prompts.models import Prompt
from django.contrib.auth.models import User
from django.utils import timezone

user = User.objects.first()
prompt = Prompt.objects.create(
    title="Test Media Issue",
    author=user,
    status=1,
    featured_image=None
)

# Before soft delete
from django.db.models import Q
no_media = Prompt.all_objects.filter(
    Q(featured_image__isnull=True) | Q(featured_image=''),
    deleted_at__isnull=True
)
print(f"Before delete: {no_media.count()} prompts")  # Should include prompt

# Soft delete
prompt.soft_delete(user)

# After soft delete
print(f"After delete: {no_media.count()} prompts")  # Should exclude prompt
```

#### Test 2: Manual Browser Test

1. **Access admin:**
   ```
   https://localhost:8000/admin/
   Navigate to Media Issues Dashboard
   ```

2. **Upload test prompt without image:**
   - Create new prompt
   - Don't upload featured_image
   - Publish it

3. **Verify it appears:**
   - Go to Media Issues Dashboard
   - Should see the test prompt

4. **Soft delete it:**
   - Go to user's prompt page
   - Click delete button
   - Soft delete moves to trash

5. **Verify it disappears:**
   - Refresh Media Issues Dashboard
   - Test prompt should be GONE
   - It should only appear in Trash Bin

## SQL Generated

### Before Fix
```sql
SELECT * FROM prompts_prompt
WHERE (featured_image IS NULL OR featured_image = '')
-- ❌ Includes soft-deleted items
-- WHERE deleted_at IS NULL is missing
```

### After Fix
```sql
SELECT * FROM prompts_prompt
WHERE (featured_image IS NULL OR featured_image = '')
  AND deleted_at IS NULL
-- ✅ Excludes soft-deleted items
```

### Reference Implementation (Working)
**File:** `prompts/views.py`
**Function:** `debug_no_media(request)`

This function already has the correct pattern:
```python
def debug_no_media(request):
    """Debug view to see all prompts without ANY media (no image OR video)."""
    from django.db.models import Q
    from django.contrib.admin.sites import site as admin_site
    # Get prompts that have NEITHER image NOR video (exclude soft-deleted)
    prompts = Prompt.all_objects.filter(
        Q(featured_image__isnull=True) | Q(featured_image=''),
        deleted_at__isnull=True  # ✅ Correct pattern
    ).select_related('author').order_by('-created_on')
    # ...
```

**Copy from:** This function shows the correct pattern.

### Soft Delete Model Methods
**File:** `prompts/models.py`

The following methods support soft delete:
- `soft_delete(user)` - Move to trash
- `restore()` - Restore from trash
- `hard_delete()` - Permanently delete

## Commit Message

```
fix(admin): Add soft delete filter to media issues dashboard

The media_issues_dashboard view was showing soft-deleted prompts
alongside active prompts with media issues. This confused admins
who had just deleted items but still saw them in the table.

Fix: Add deleted_at__isnull=True filter to exclude soft-deleted
prompts, matching the pattern already used in debug_no_media view.

Results:
- Soft-deleted prompts now excluded from media issues table
- Items disappear immediately after deletion
- Matches debug_no_media implementation pattern
- Single line addition, no performance impact

Fixes Issue: Media issues page shows deleted items
Fixes Issue: Items don't disappear after bulk delete
```

## Impact Analysis

### What This Affects
- ✅ Admin Media Issues Dashboard
- ✅ Soft-deleted prompt visibility
- ❌ NOT user-facing features (admin only)
- ❌ NOT any other views or functionality

### What This Doesn't Affect
- ✅ Public prompt list
- ✅ User dashboards
- ✅ Trash bin functionality
- ✅ Soft delete mechanism
- ✅ Database schema

### Performance Impact
- **None** - Filter uses existing indexed field
- Database query unchanged (same logic, just explicit)
- No additional queries

## Edge Cases Verified

### Edge Case 1: No Media Issues
**Scenario:** All prompts have media
**Result:** Dashboard shows empty (correct)

### Edge Case 2: Mix of Active and Deleted
**Scenario:** 5 active prompts without media, 3 deleted without media
**Result:** Shows 5 active, hides 3 deleted (correct)

### Edge Case 3: Bulk Delete
**Scenario:** Select 3 prompts, bulk delete them
**Result:** All 3 disappear after page refresh (correct with fix)

### Edge Case 4: Restore from Trash
**Scenario:** Restore prompt that was deleted
**Result:** Reappears in dashboard if it still has no media (correct)

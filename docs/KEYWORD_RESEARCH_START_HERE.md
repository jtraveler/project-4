**Quick Reference for Your SEO Content Strategy**
**Generated:** December 11, 2025

---

## 📌 TL;DR (Top Takeaways)

### The Bottom Line

PromptFinder is entering an **undersaturated, high-growth market**. AI prompt discovery is booming, and most competitors are either:
- **Marketplaces** (PromptBase - sell prompts)
- **Aggregators** (PromptHero - community site)
- **Blogs** (generic "best prompts" articles)
- **Reddit** (unorganized discussion)

**None focus on organized, discoverable, user-generated, community-driven prompt discovery.**

This is PromptFinder's competitive advantage.

### Your Content Strategy in 3 Sentences

1. **Weeks 1-4:** Publish 5-10 high-volume blog posts targeting Tier 1 keywords (Midjourney, DALL-E, Stable Diffusion prompts)
2. **Weeks 5-12:** Publish 40-50 long-tail blog posts targeting Tier 2 keywords (style + generator combinations: cyberpunk Midjourney, fantasy DALL-E, etc.)
3. **Months 4+:** Build authority with use-case content, comparison posts, and capitalize on emerging video AI trend

### Expected Results (12 Months)

- **Organic Traffic:** 10 visits/day (month 1) → 100+ visits/day (month 3) → 500+ visits/day (month 6) → 1,000-2,000 visits/day (month 12)
- **Blog Posts:** 10 published → 50 published → 100+ published
- **Keyword Rankings:** 0 top-20 rankings → 30+ rankings → 100+ rankings
- **Conversions:** Free → Premium, Blog Traffic → Prompt Creators

## 🎯 Three-Tier Keyword Strategy

### TIER 1: High-Volume Keywords (Do Now)

These are the "bread and butter" keywords. High search volume, moderate competition.

```
PRIMARY KEYWORDS (Focus Here):
- Midjourney prompts (15K-50K searches/month)
- DALL-E 3 prompts (12K-35K)
- DALL-E prompts (8K-30K)
- Stable Diffusion prompts (5K-20K)

ACTION: Create category pages + 1-2 blog posts per generator
TIMELINE: Weeks 1-4
EFFORT: 10-15 hours total
EXPECTED TRAFFIC: 50-200 organic visits/day after ranking
```

### TIER 2: Long-Tail Keywords (Do Next)

These are the "volume drivers." Lower search volume per keyword, but 50+ keywords = massive traffic.

```
EXAMPLES:
- Cyberpunk Midjourney prompts (500-2K/month)
- Fantasy DALL-E prompts (300-1.5K/month)
- Best Midjourney prompts (800-3K/month)
- Anime character prompts (1K-3K/month)
- Portrait prompts (500-2K/month)
- Free Stable Diffusion prompts (400-1.5K/month)

ACTION: Create 1 blog post per keyword (1,500-2,000 words each)
TIMELINE: Weeks 5-12 (publish 1-2 per week)
EFFORT: 2-3 hours per post × 50 posts = 100-150 hours
EXPECTED TRAFFIC: 2,000-5,000 additional visits/day from 50 posts
```

### TIER 3: Emerging Keywords (Build Authority)

These are the "first-mover advantages." Video AI tools just launched with zero competition.

```
EXAMPLES:
- Sora 2 prompts (50-300/month NOW, growing to 10K+ in 2026)
- Runway Gen-4.5 prompts (100-500/month)
- AI video prompts (500-2K/month)

ACTION: Publish 5-10 guides on video AI immediately
TIMELINE: Months 4-6 (content will dominate in 2026)
EFFORT: 10-15 hours
EXPECTED TRAFFIC: Explosive growth in 2026 (these are "seed content")
```

## ❓ FAQ

### Q: How long until I see organic traffic?
**A:**
- Week 2-3: First rankings appearing (page 3-5)
- Week 4-6: Page 2 rankings
- Week 8-12: Page 1 rankings (top 10)
- First organic traffic usually around week 3-4

### Q: Do I need paid ads to rank?
**A:** No. Paid ads and organic SEO are completely separate. However, paid ads can help you test content ideas quickly (which paid searches convert best) before investing time in organic content.

### Q: How much content do I really need?
**A:**
- Minimum: 10-15 blog posts to establish presence
- Optimal: 50+ blog posts to dominate your niche
- Ideal: 100+ blog posts for complete market dominance
- Law of diminishing returns kicks in after 100+ posts (growth slows)

### Q: Which keywords should I target first?
**A:** Start with Tier 2 long-tail keywords (Cyberpunk Midjourney, Fantasy DALL-E). They:
- Rank faster (less competition)
- Convert better (specific intent)
- Get you initial traffic (momentum)

THEN leverage that authority to rank for Tier 1 keywords.

### Q: Should I create YouTube videos?
**A:** Yes, but later. Priority:
1. Blog content (easiest, fastest ROI)
2. SEO optimization of existing content
3. Link building
4. YouTube content (month 6+)

### Q: How do I get backlinks?
**A:** After month 3, when you have 30+ quality articles:
1. Email outreach to related blogs
2. Guest posts on AI art blogs
3. Resource roundups ("50 AI Art Blogs")
4. Interviews with creators
5. Naturally earned (best articles attract links)

### Q: What about social media?
**A:** Social media is secondary to organic SEO for PromptFinder. But they work together:
- Blog drives organic traffic
- Social drives brand awareness
- Both drive premium conversions
- Start with blog, add social in month 4-6

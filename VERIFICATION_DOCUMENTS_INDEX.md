## Recommendations Summary

1. **Do not deploy Phase F** until confirmation dialog is added to bulk delete
2. **Add selection count display** for better UX
3. **Update documentation** to reflect flexbox layout
4. **Consider switching to mark_safe()** in views (optional, future refactoring)

**Expected deployment impact:** Critical issue (data loss risk) must be fixed first

## Django ORM Syntax (The Core Concept)

Your proposed syntax follows Django's standard pattern:

```python
# This is how Django works:
Model.manager.filter(
    Q(condition1) | Q(condition2),    # Q objects handle OR/NOT logic
    field3=value                      # Regular params are implicitly ANDed
)

# Translates to SQL:
WHERE (condition1 OR condition2) AND field3=value
```

This is the standard Django pattern used throughout the framework.

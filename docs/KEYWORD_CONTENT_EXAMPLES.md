#### 2. SECTION 1: WHY MIDJOURNEY PROMPTS MATTER (200 words)

```
SECTION HEADING: Why Midjourney Prompts Are Game-Changing

[Explain the difference between good and bad prompts, with brief example]

The difference between a mediocre AI image and a stunning one comes down to
one thing: your prompt.

A vague prompt like "a dog" generates a random dog image. But a detailed
prompt like "a corgi wearing a Victorian collar in a royal palace, soft
diffused lighting, intricate oil painting, trending on artstation, digital
art" generates a masterpiece worthy of a book cover.

This is why the best Midjourney prompts aren't just random descriptions—they're
carefully crafted formulas that combine:

• Subject (what you want to see)
• Style/Medium (painting, photograph, digital art)
• Aesthetic/Mood (cinematic, dreamy, dark, ethereal)
• Technical details (lighting, composition, quality)
• Reference artists or inspirations ("in the style of Greg Rutkowski")

Understanding this structure is what separates amateur results from professional
work. And it's exactly what you'll learn in this guide.

#### 3. SECTION 2: THE 5-PART PROMPT FORMULA (250 words)

```
SECTION HEADING: The 5-Part Midjourney Prompt Formula (Works 90% of the Time)

Professional Midjourney users follow a simple formula that generates
consistently stunning results. Here it is:

[SUBJECT], [STYLE], [AESTHETIC], [LIGHTING/COMPOSITION], [QUALITY]

Let's break each part down:

PART 1: SUBJECT
Your subject is the main thing you want to see.
✓ "a dragon" (too vague)
✓ "an ancient red dragon with glowing eyes perched on a golden hoard" (better)
✓ "a majestic scarlet dragon with scales that shimmer like rubies,
   perched atop a mountain of gold coins, gripping an ornate staff" (best)

THE RULE: Specific subjects generate better images than vague ones.

PART 2: STYLE/MEDIUM
How should it be rendered? Photography? Painting? Sculpture? Digital art?
Examples:
- "oil painting"
- "cyberpunk digital art"
- "ultra-detailed photograph"
- "anime illustration"
- "concept art"

PART 3: AESTHETIC/MOOD
The feeling or vibe of the image:
- Cinematic
- Dreamy
- Dark and moody
- Ethereal
- Gritty
- Whimsical

PART 4: LIGHTING & COMPOSITION
How is it lit? How is it framed?
- "soft diffused lighting"
- "dramatic backlighting"
- "volumetric lighting"
- "shot from above"
- "close-up"
- "wide angle landscape"

PART 5: QUALITY MODIFIERS
Words that universally improve image quality:
- "8K resolution"
- "ultra-detailed"
- "photorealistic"
- "intricate"
- "award-winning"
- "trending on artstation"
- "masterpiece"

EXAMPLE PROMPT USING THIS FORMULA:
"A majestic red dragon perched on a golden hoard, oil painting, cinematic
lighting, dramatic backlighting, dark moody atmosphere, intricate details,
8K resolution, trending on artstation, masterpiece --ar 16:9"

SECTION HEADING: 5 Advanced Midjourney Prompting Techniques

Once you've mastered the basic formula, try these advanced techniques used by
professional designers:

**TECHNIQUE 1: Artist References**
Include specific artists whose style you want to emulate:
- "in the style of Greg Rutkowski"
- "by Beeple"

**TECHNIQUE 2: Negative Prompts**
Exclude things you DON'T want:

**TECHNIQUE 3: Aspect Ratio Control**
Control image dimensions:
- "--ar 16:9" for widescreen
- "--ar 9:16" for portrait
- "--ar 1:1" for square

**TECHNIQUE 4: Quality Settings**
Fine-tune rendering quality:
- "--niji 6" for anime style
- "--s 250" for more stylization
- "--iw 0.5" for weaker image references

**TECHNIQUE 5: Seed Control**
Get consistent variations:
"Same prompt --seed 12345" generates variations on that seed

These techniques separate casual users from professionals. Experiment with each
one to master Midjourney.

```
#### How to Write Effective Midjourney Prompts

Writing a good Midjourney prompt is a learnable skill. Most users see dramatic
improvements after their first 10-20 prompts.

Follow this 5-step formula:

**STEP 1: Describe Your Subject**
Be specific. Instead of "a cat," try "a fluffy orange tabby cat sitting on a
velvet cushion, whiskers catching sunlight."

**STEP 2: Specify Your Medium/Style**
Photography? Painting? Digital art? Animation? This dramatically changes the
output.
- "oil painting" = classical, painterly feel
- "photorealistic" = like a photograph
- "digital art" = modern, vibrant
- "anime" = Japanese animation style

**STEP 3: Add Aesthetic & Mood**
Cinematic? Dreamy? Dark? Whimsical?
- "cinematic" = dramatic, professional movie feel
- "ethereal" = ghostly, dreamlike
- "gritty" = rough, authentic
- "whimsical" = playful, lighthearted

**STEP 4: Include Lighting & Composition Details**
This is where beginner prompts become professional.
- "soft diffused lighting" = gentle, flattering
- "dramatic backlighting" = cinematic, moody
- "volumetric lighting" = atmospheric, visible light rays
- "shot from above" = bird's eye view
- "close-up" = detail focus

**STEP 5: Add Quality Modifiers**
End with words that universally improve image quality:
- "8K resolution"
- "intricate details"
- "award-winning"
- "trending on artstation"
- "masterpiece"

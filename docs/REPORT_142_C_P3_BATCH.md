# REPORT: 142-C — P3 Batch (Single-Box Clear B2 Delete, nosniff, SDK Note)

**Spec:** `CC_SPEC_142_C_P3_BATCH.md`
**Session:** 142
**Date:** March 21, 2026

---

## Section 1 — Overview

This spec addressed three small P3 items: (1) the single-box ✕ clear button was not
firing a B2 delete for paste images, leaving orphaned files in B2; (2) the download
proxy (`/api/bulk-gen/download/`) was missing `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`; and
(3) the discovery that GPT-Image-1 requires `client.images.edit()` for reference images
needed permanent documentation in CLAUDE.md.

## Section 2 — Expectations

| Criterion | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| B2 delete fires BEFORE `clearInput.value = ''` | ✅ Met (line 399 vs 413) |
| `clearInput` null guard present | ✅ Met (line 397) |
| Fetch pattern matches `deleteBox` | ✅ Met (same endpoint, headers, body) |
| `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` on download proxy | ✅ Met (line 929) |
| Both proxies now have nosniff | ✅ Met (lines 929 and 1088) |
| `images.edit()` SDK note in CLAUDE.md | ✅ Met (line 449) |
| 5 agents score 8.0+ average | ✅ Met (9.4 average) |

## Section 3 — Changes Made

### static/js/bulk-generator.js
- **Lines 390-420:** Replaced the single-box ✕ clear handler. Added B2 delete fetch
  that fires BEFORE `clearInput.value = ''`. The fetch uses the same endpoint
  (`/api/bulk-gen/source-image-paste/delete/`), same headers (`Content-Type` +
  `X-CSRFToken: csrf`), and same body format (`{ cdn_url: clearUrl }`) as `deleteBox`.
  Added `clearInput` null guard wrapping both the fetch and value clear. Non-blocking
  `.catch(console.warn)` with `[PASTE-DELETE]` prefix for debugging.

### prompts/views/upload_api_views.py
- **Line 929:** Added `response['X-Content-Type-Options'] = 'nosniff'` to the download
  proxy response, after `Content-Disposition` and before `Content-Length`. Both proxy
  endpoints now have this header.

### CLAUDE.md
- **Line 449:** Added SDK note documenting that GPT-Image-1 reference images require
  `client.images.edit(image=ref_file, ...)` not `client.images.generate()`. Documents
  the `BytesIO` + `.name` attribute pattern.

### Step 4 Verification Grep Outputs

**Grep 1 — B2 delete ordering:**
```
399: if (clearUrl && clearUrl.indexOf('/source-paste/') !== -1) {
409: '[PASTE-DELETE] single-box fetch failed:', err
413: clearInput.value = '';
```
Confirmed: delete at 399, clear at 413 — correct order.

**Grep 2 — clearInput null guard:**
```
397: if (clearInput) {
```

**Grep 3 — nosniff on both proxies:**
```
929: response['X-Content-Type-Options'] = 'nosniff'
1088: response['X-Content-Type-Options'] = 'nosniff'
```

**Grep 4 — SDK note:**
```
449: - **OpenAI SDK note (Session 141):** GPT-Image-1 reference images require
     `client.images.edit(image=ref_file, ...)` ...
```

## Section 4 — Issues Encountered and Resolved

No issues encountered during implementation.

## Section 5 — Remaining Issues

No remaining issues. All spec objectives met.

## Section 6 — Concerns and Areas for Improvement

**Concern:** `deleteBox` silently swallows `.catch` (no log), while single-box clear
and `clearAllConfirm` both log with `[PASTE-DELETE]` prefix.
**Impact:** Paste-delete failures from box deletion are invisible to developers.
**Recommended action:** Add `console.warn('[PASTE-DELETE] deleteBox fetch failed:', err)`
to `deleteBox`'s `.catch` handler. P4 consistency item.

## Section 7 — Agent Ratings

| Round | Agent | Score | Key Findings | Acted On? |
|-------|-------|-------|--------------|-----------|
| 1 | @frontend-developer | 10/10 | URL capture order correct, null guard correct, csrf in scope, pattern matches deleteBox exactly | N/A — all correct |
| 1 | @javascript-pro | 9/10 | ES5 clean, no shadowing, [PASTE-DELETE] prefix matches. Minor: deleteBox .catch is silent (pre-existing) | Documented as P4 |
| 1 | @security-auditor | 9/10 | 3-layer server validation confirmed. CSRF correct. nosniff on both proxies. No path traversal possible. | N/A |
| 1 | @django-pro | 10/10 | Header assignment correct on StreamingHttpResponse. Error paths don't need nosniff. | N/A |
| 1 | @code-reviewer | 9/10 | Cross-file consistency confirmed. SDK note accurate. All verification outputs match. | N/A |
| **Average** | | **9.4/10** | | **Pass ≥ 8.0** |

## Section 8 — Recommended Additional Agents

All relevant agents were included. No additional agents would have added material value.

## Section 9 — How to Test

**Automated:**
```bash
python manage.py test
# Expected: 1193 tests, 0 failures, 12 skipped
```

**Manual browser checks (Mateo must verify):**
1. Paste image into prompt → click ✕ clear button → check Heroku logs for `[PASTE-DELETE]`

## Section 10 — Commits

| Hash | Message |
|------|---------|
| *(see below)* | fix(bulk-gen): single-box clear fires B2 delete, nosniff on download proxy, SDK note in docs |

## Section 11 — What to Work on Next

1. Add `console.warn` to `deleteBox`'s `.catch` for consistency — P4
2. Consider Content-Type validation on download proxy (image/* prefix check) — P3

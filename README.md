## Welcome to PromptFlow â€“ Your Creative AI Community!

Developed for Project 4 of the Code Institute Full-Stack Development Program, this prompt sharing project is a full-stack Django project hosted on Heroku.

**PromptFlow** is a community platform built for creators who work with AI image generation. Each prompt is paired with a preview image, allowing users to browse, share, and search through a growing collection of visual references and the exact text that generated them. The result is a practical resource for creative development, experimentation, and learning.

The platform supports both beginners and experienced users by making the prompt-writing process transparent and easy to explore. By allowing members to comment on and like prompts, PromptFlow encourages ongoing participation and shared learning within the community.

The homepage is designed to highlight the most recent prompts first, encouraging frequent visits and steady user engagement. This content flow not only keeps the experience fresh but also contributes to long-term SEO performance by increasing time on site and activity across the platform.

# Agile Methodology

This project was built using the [Project 4 - Prompts Kanban Board](https://github.com/users/jtraveler/projects/4/views/1). This approach helped me build PromptFlow step by step and make changes as needed during development.

I used GitHub Issues and Projects to organize my work. The platform's features were grouped into Epics, with each Epic containing smaller User Stories. An Epic covers a major feature area, while User Stories focus on what users need to do. I used a simple board with three columns: To Do, In Progress, and Done to track my progress.

## Epic Organization

I organized the entire project into **4 main epics** that cover everything the platform does:

- **[EPIC] Core Platform Features** - Basic features like user accounts, creating prompts, and main navigation
- **[EPIC] Community Features** - Ways users interact with each other through comments and likes
- **[EPIC] Discovery & Search Features** - Tools to help users find prompts through search and tags
- **[EPIC] Performance & UX** - Making the site fast and easy to use on all devices

Each epic had several user stories that moved through the board as I worked on them. Stories started in To Do, moved to In Progress when I began working, and ended in Done when they were finished and tested.

## Development Configuration

- **IDE:** VS Code with Python extension
- **Environment:** Virtual environment (venv)
- **Version Control:** Git with GitHub integration
- **Deployment:** Heroku with automatic deployment enabled
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (production), SQLite (development)

## Project Implementation Notes

This project followed Code Institute's Django tutorial series, adapting the blog-style tutorials for a AI prompt sharing platform. Key adaptations included replacing "blog" references with "prompts" and "post" references with "prompt" throughout the codebase.



# PostgreSQL Setup

The production database was configured using PostgreSQL to ensure reliable data persistence on the Heroku platform. The database was provisioned through the Code Institute PostgreSQL database creation tool, which provided a managed database instance for the project.

The database connection was configured using environment variables, with the `DATABASE_URL` stored in the local `env.py` file for development and added to Heroku config vars for production. Required dependencies including `psycopg2-binary` and `dj-database-url` were installed to enable PostgreSQL connectivity.

Django settings were updated to use `dj_database_url.parse()` for automatic database connection handling, enabling seamless switching between SQLite for local development and PostgreSQL for production. Database migrations were successfully applied using `heroku run python manage.py migrate`, and a superuser account was created for admin access.

## Database Configuration:
- **Development:** SQLite database for local testing
- **Production:** PostgreSQL database on Heroku
- **Connection:** Automatic switching based on `DATABASE_URL` environment variable

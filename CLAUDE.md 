## üö® Known Issues & Technical Debt

### Critical Issues (Fix in Phase 1)
1. **Orphaned Cloudinary Assets**
   - **Problem:** When prompts deleted, Cloudinary files not removed
   - **Impact:** Wasted storage, costs increase over time
   - **Solution:** Django signal to call `cloudinary.uploader.destroy()` on delete
   - **Effort:** 4 hours

2. **Code Institute PostgreSQL Dependency**
   - **Problem:** Database expires 2026-2027, not independent
   - **Impact:** Platform unusable after expiration
   - **Solution:** Migrate to Heroku PostgreSQL Mini
   - **Effort:** 2 hours (data export/import)

3. **No Content Moderation**
   - **Problem:** No safeguards against inappropriate content
   - **Impact:** Legal liability, brand damage, user safety
   - **Solution:** Multi-layer AI moderation system
   - **Effort:** 3-4 days

### UI/UX Issues (Fix in Phase 1-2)
1. **Prompt Detail Page:**
   - [ ] Preview image displaying incorrectly (sizing/alignment)
   - [ ] Content layout needs reorganization (description not prominent enough)
   - [ ] Mobile responsiveness issues
   
2. **General UI:**
   - [ ] Inconsistent styling across pages
   - [ ] Form validation display problems
   - [ ] Button hover states missing
   - [ ] (Add specific issues as discovered)

### Future Considerations (Phase 3+)
- Video optimization for different devices/connections
- Advanced caching strategy
- Database query optimization at scale
- Real-time features (WebSockets for live notifications)

## ‚úÖ Decisions Made

### Infrastructure Decisions

**1. Database: Heroku PostgreSQL (NOT Supabase)**
- **Reasoning:** 
  - Easy migration from Code Institute
  - Integrated with Heroku hosting
  - Adequate for projected scale
  - Covered by Heroku credits
- **Alternative Considered:** Supabase
- **Why Rejected:** No significant benefit, migration effort not justified

**2. Media Storage: Cloudinary (PERMANENT - NOT Supabase)**
- **Reasoning:**
  - Automatic image optimization (thumbnails, WebP, compression)
  - Built-in AI moderation and tagging
  - CDN included
  - Transformations on-the-fly
  - Cost scales with success (5-7% of revenue)
- **Alternative Considered:** Supabase Storage + custom image processing
- **Why Rejected:**
  - Would require 2 weeks development (Pillow, FFmpeg)
  - Ongoing maintenance burden
  - Lose automatic optimization features
  - Only saves $500/month at 10K users (not worth effort)
  - Break-even: 7.5 years
- **Migration Decision:** Stick with Cloudinary indefinitely
- **Rationale:** "If Cloudinary costs are a problem, business is good. At that point, we can afford Cloudinary."

**3. Hosting: Heroku**
- **Reasoning:**
  - $248 credits (covers costs until late 2026)
  - Easy deployment
  - AWS infrastructure (reliable, fast)
  - Custom domain support
  - 99.9% uptime SLA
- **Cost:** $10/month (covered by credits currently)

### Monetization Decisions

**4. Trial Period: 14 Days with Card Required**
- **Reasoning:**
  - Higher conversion (60-70% vs 10-20% without card)
  - Filters serious users
  - Industry standard for SaaS
  - Allows "forgot to cancel" revenue (ethical gray area but standard)
  - Two weeks gives users time to see value
- **Alternative Considered:** 7 days, no card required
- **Why 14 Days:** Product needs time to show value (users upload, get engagement, see results)
- **Why Card Required:** Conversion rate 3-4x higher
- **Implementation:**
  - Clear messaging: "Free for 14 days, then $7/month. Cancel anytime."
  - Email reminders: Day 11, Day 13
  - 24-hour refund grace period (no questions asked)
  - One-click cancellation in dashboard

**5. Pricing: $7/month (Monthly), $70/year (Annual)**
- **Free Tier:** 10 uploads/week (launch phase) ‚Üí 5-10/month (growth phase)
- **Premium Tier:** Unlimited uploads + all features
- **Annual Discount:** Save $14/year (2 months free)
- **Target Conversion:** 10% free ‚Üí premium

**6. Upload Limits Strategy**
- **Launch Phase (Months 1-6):** 10 uploads/week for free users
  - **Goal:** Build content library quickly
  - **Rationale:** Empty platform = no value = no retention
- **Growth Phase (Month 6+):** 5-10 uploads/month for free users
  - **Goal:** Create upgrade pressure
  - **Announcement:** 30 days advance notice with upgrade CTA
  - **Admin Config:** Easily switchable via settings

**7. PromptCoins Gamification**
- **Purpose:** Engage free users, create multiple monetization paths
- **Earning:** Uploads, likes, comments, daily login, referrals
- **Spending:** Temporary premium features, featured slots, extra uploads
- **Premium Benefit:** 2x earning rate + monthly allowance
- **Purchase Option:** Buy coins via Stripe ($2.99 - $19.99)
- **Rationale:** "Earning is slow, but premium members get 2x..." (conversion funnel)

### SEO Decisions

**8. SEO Filename Strategy: Prompt Text + AI Fallback**
- **Primary:** Extract keywords from user's prompt text (FREE)
- **Fallback:** AI tagging if prompt < 5 words (costs ~$0.50/1000)
- **Format:** `keyword1-keyword2-[ai-generator]-prompt-[timestamp].jpg`
- **Reasoning:** User prompts are already keyword-rich, saves AI costs
- **Example:** `cyberpunk-neon-cityscape-midjourney-prompt-1234567890.jpg`

**9. Thumbnails: Cloudinary Transformations (NOT Separate Files)**
- **Strategy:** One master image, generate thumbnails via URL transformations
- **Benefits:** Saves storage, automatic caching, no duplication
- **Alt Tags:** Context-specific (different alt for thumbnail vs full image)
- **Example Transformation:** `/c_fill,w_300,h_200,g_auto,q_auto,f_auto/`

**10. SEO Consistency: Include "[AI Generator] Prompt" Everywhere**
- **H1:** `"[Title] - [AI Generator] Prompt"`
- **Alt Tag:** `"[Title] - [AI Generator] Prompt - AI-generated image"`
- **Filename:** `"[keywords]-[ai-generator]-prompt-[timestamp].jpg"`
- **Reasoning:** Captures searches like "midjourney prompt [topic]"

### Content Moderation Decisions

**11. AI Moderation: Multi-Layer Approach**
- **Layer 1:** AWS Rekognition (via Cloudinary) - standard moderation
- **Layer 2:** Cloudinary AI Vision - custom checks (minors, gore, satanic)
- **Layer 3:** OpenAI Moderation API - text moderation (FREE)
- **Cost:** ~$6-11 per 1000 images (extremely affordable)
- **Custom Rules:**
  - ZERO TOLERANCE: Minors, gore, satanic imagery, hate symbols
  - STRICT: Explicit nudity (0.2 threshold), violence (0.3)
  - MODERATE: Drugs (0.6), gambling (0.7)

**12. Comments: Keep with AI Moderation (NOT Disable)**
- **Reasoning:**
  - SEO critical (fresh content, engagement signals)
  - AI catches 90%+ of issues
  - Very cheap ($1-5/month)
  - Scalable (works at any volume)
- **Alternative Considered:** Disable comments entirely
- **Why Rejected:** SEO impact too severe
- **Implementation:**
  - Auto-approve (>0.8 confidence, safe)
  - Auto-remove (>0.8 confidence, violation)
  - Flag for review (0.5-0.8 confidence)
  - Admin reviews flagged comments (~30 min/day)

**13. AI Bot Personality: Helpful, NOT Snarky**
- **Decision:** AI bot is supportive, encouraging, educational
- **Rejected:** Snarky/sassy responses to users
- **Reasoning:**
  - Legal liability (defamation, discrimination)
  - Brand damage (unprofessional)
  - Escalation risk (toxicity spiral)
  - AI mistakes (misreads sarcasm)
  - Professional platform for monetization
- **Use Cases:**
  - Celebrate achievements
  - Answer questions
  - Provide tips
  - Never engages in drama/snark

### Social & Growth Decisions

**14. Soft Launch: Invite-Only (First 2-4 Weeks)**
- **Strategy:** Closed beta with invite codes
- **Benefits:**
  - Controlled scaling (manage server load)
  - Bug fixes before public launch
  - FOMO marketing ("Request invite")
  - Viral growth (users invite friends)
  - Quality control (invited users = engaged users)
- **Gamification:** 500 PromptCoins per successful invite

**15. Social Login: Google + Apple (Phase 1 End)**
- **Priority:** Google (70% users), Apple (15% users)
- **Skip:** Yahoo (dying), Microsoft (overkill), LinkedIn (not relevant)
- **Phase 2:** Facebook (if data shows demand)
- **Reasoning:** Critical for conversion, reduces signup friction 20-40%

**16. Tag Strategy: Hybrid User + AI**
- **User Action:** Selects up to 3 tags from 27 presets
- **AI Action:** Pre-populates suggested tags, validates selection
- **If Mismatch:** Approve anyway, flag for admin, auto-correct if not reviewed in 2-4 days
- **User Never Knows:** Seamless UX, no delays
- **Admin Control:** Toggle on/off, configure review deadline

### Brand & Marketing Decisions

**17. Brand Name: PromptFinder (NOT PromptFlow)**
- **Domain:** promptfinder.net
- **Reasoning:**
  - Search intent aligned ("find prompts")
  - Clear purpose
  - Marketing goldmine ("prompt finders" = user identity)
  - Better SEO (matches search behavior)
- **User Identity:** "Prompt Finders" (not "users")
- **Tagline:** "Find. Create. Share."
- **Mission:** "Make every prompt finder successful"

## üîß Development Best Practices

### Code Style

**Python/Django:**
- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Type hints where helpful
- Docstrings for complex functions
- Meaningful variable names (not overly verbose)
- Keep views thin (logic in models/services)
- Use Django ORM (avoid raw SQL unless necessary)

**JavaScript:**
- ES6+ syntax
- Const/let (not var)
- Arrow functions
- Template literals
- Descriptive function names
- Comments for complex logic

**Templates:**
- Consistent indentation (2 spaces)
- Semantic HTML5 tags
- Accessibility attributes (ARIA labels, alt tags)
- DRY principle (use includes/extends)

**CSS:**
- Mobile-first approach
- Use Bootstrap utilities when possible
- Custom CSS in separate file
- BEM naming convention for custom classes
- Avoid !important

### Git Workflow

**Branches:**
- `main` - Production-ready code
- `develop` - Integration branch
- `feature/feature-name` - New features
- `bugfix/bug-description` - Bug fixes
- `hotfix/critical-issue` - Urgent production fixes

**Commit Messages:**
Format: `<type>: <description>`

**Types:**
- `feat` - New feature
- `fix` - Bug fix
- `refactor` - Code refactoring
- `style` - CSS/UI changes
- `docs` - Documentation updates
- `test` - Test additions/changes
- `chore` - Maintenance tasks

**Examples:**
- `feat: Add AI comment moderation system`
- `fix: Resolve image upload validation error`
- `refactor: Optimize database queries for prompt list`
- `style: Update navbar responsive breakpoints`

### Testing Strategy

**Phase 1-2 (Manual Testing Priority):**
- [ ] Test all user flows manually
- [ ] Cross-browser testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- [ ] Mobile testing (iOS Safari, Android Chrome)
- [ ] Edge cases (empty states, errors, limits)

**Phase 3+ (Automated Testing):**
- [ ] Unit tests for critical functions
- [ ] Integration tests for API endpoints
- [ ] End-to-end tests for key user flows
- [ ] Performance testing (load testing)
- [ ] Security testing (penetration testing)

**Test Coverage Goal:** 70%+ by Phase 4

### Deployment Process

**Phase 1-2 (Manual Deployment):**
1. Test locally
2. Test in Heroku staging environment (if created)
3. Merge to `main`
4. Deploy to Heroku production
5. Smoke test production (verify key features)
6. Monitor error logs (Sentry, Heroku logs)

**Phase 3+ (CI/CD Pipeline):**
1. GitHub Actions on push to `develop`
2. Run tests automatically
3. Deploy to staging if tests pass
4. Manual approval for production deploy
5. Automated rollback if errors spike

### Security Best Practices

**Always:**
- [ ] Never commit secrets (.env files, API keys)
- [ ] Use Django's built-in CSRF protection
- [ ] Sanitize user input
- [ ] Validate file uploads (type, size)
- [ ] Rate limit API endpoints
- [ ] HTTPS only (redirect HTTP)
- [ ] Secure cookies (httponly, secure, samesite)
- [ ] Regular dependency updates (security patches)
- [ ] Content Security Policy headers
- [ ] SQL injection prevention (use ORM)
- [ ] XSS prevention (template auto-escaping)

## üé¨ Getting Started (For Future Claude Instances)

### When Starting a New Chat About PromptFinder:

**Read this document first**, then:

1. **Check current phase:** Are we in Phase 1, 2, 3, or 4?
2. **Review decisions made:** Don't revisit settled decisions unless explicitly asked
3. **Check unanswered questions:** Prioritize addressing these if relevant
4. **Understand context:** This is a real project transitioning to monetization
5. **Be specific:** Provide actionable advice, code examples, timelines
6. **Prioritize:** Always consider what's critical vs nice-to-have
7. **Remember the brand:** Users are "Prompt Finders," domain is promptfinder.net

### Quick Reference Commands

‚Üí Check Content Moderation section

### Project Philosophy

**Core Principles:**
1. **Users first:** Every decision prioritizes user experience
2. **Monetization matters:** We're building a sustainable business
3. **SEO is critical:** Discovery-focused platform needs great SEO
4. **Safety always:** Zero tolerance for harmful content
5. **Start simple:** MVP features first, polish later
6. **Data-driven:** A/B test, measure, iterate
7. **Professional:** Build for paying customers, not hobby project

**What We're Building:**
A professional, safe, profitable platform where prompt finders discover perfect AI prompts. We're competing with generic Google searches and scattered Discord servers by offering curated, organized, SEO-optimized prompt discovery.

**What We're NOT Building:**
- Social media platform (light social features only)
- NSFW content site (strict moderation)
- Free-forever charity (we need revenue)
- Feature-bloated complexity (focused simplicity)

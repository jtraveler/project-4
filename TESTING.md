## All Pages

# Code Validation

## HTML Validation
### [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)

All HTML templates were tested using the W3C HTML Validator to ensure compliance with HTML5 standards. The validation was performed on the following key pages:

- **Homepage** (`/`) - Prompts listing with pagination and tag filtering
- **About Page** (`/about/`) - About section with profile information  
- **Collaborate Page** (`/collaborate/`) - Contact form for collaboration requests
- **Prompt Detail Page** (`/prompt/epic-fusion-of-science-and-space-adventure/`) - Individual prompt viewing with comments

All pages passed HTML validation with no errors or warnings after addressing initial validation issues including proper heading hierarchy, meta tag corrections, and removal of invalid attributes. There is one Google error but that seems to be related to Google.

## CSS Validation
### [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

The custom CSS stylesheet was validated using the W3C CSS Validation Service to ensure proper syntax and compliance with CSS3 standards. All custom styles passed validation without errors.

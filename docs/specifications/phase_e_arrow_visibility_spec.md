# Phase E - Arrow Visibility System Specification

**Date:** October 2025
**Status:** âœ… Implemented
**Related Commit:** See PHASE_E_IMPLEMENTATION_REPORT.md

---

## Purpose

This document contains the original specification provided to Claude Code for implementing the dynamic arrow visibility system on the user profile page.

---

## Problem Statement

Overflow arrow buttons existed in the DOM and were clickable, but remained invisible (opacity: 0) because there was no JavaScript logic to dynamically show/hide them based on scroll position and overflow state.

---

## Solution Overview

Implement complete arrow visibility management with:
1. `checkOverflow()` - Detects horizontal overflow
2. `updateArrowVisibility()` - Shows/hides arrows based on scroll position
3. Event listeners for scroll, resize, and page load
4. Arrow click handlers with 300ms timeout updates
5. Keyboard navigation support

# Django ORM Soft Delete Filter - Answer Summary

**Your Question:** Verify the correct pattern for adding a soft delete filter to a Django QuerySet.

**Status:** ✅ VERIFIED AND APPROVED
**Date:** October 31, 2025

## Quick Answer

**YES, your proposed fix is 100% correct.**

```python
# ✅ CORRECT Django ORM syntax
Prompt.all_objects.filter(
    Q(featured_image__isnull=True) | Q(featured_image=''),
    deleted_at__isnull=True  # ← This is the right way
)
```

---

## Your Four Questions - Answered

### Question 1: Is This the Correct Django ORM Syntax?

**Answer: YES, 100% correct.**

This is the standard Django pattern for combining:
- Q objects with OR logic: `Q(field1) | Q(field2)`
- Regular field filters: `field3=value`

The implicit AND between Q object and regular parameters is standard Django behavior.

**Verification:**
- ✅ Matches Django documentation examples
- ✅ Matches working code in your codebase (`debug_no_media` function)
- ✅ Generates correct SQL
- ✅ Follows Django best practices

---

### Question 2: Should the deleted_at Filter Be Inside Q() or Outside?

**Answer: OUTSIDE is the correct and preferred choice.**

```python
# ✅ PREFERRED (your approach)
.filter(
    Q(featured_image__isnull=True) | Q(featured_image=''),
    deleted_at__isnull=True  # Outside Q object
)

# ❌ LESS PREFERRED (but technically valid)
.filter(
    Q(
        Q(featured_image__isnull=True) | Q(featured_image='')
    ) & Q(deleted_at__isnull=True)
)
```

**Why outside is better:**
1. **Cleaner syntax** - Less nesting, easier to read
2. **Django convention** - Standard pattern across Django codebase
3. **Implicit AND** - Django automatically ANDs regular parameters with Q objects
4. **Performance identical** - No difference in generated SQL or execution speed

---

### Question 3: Is There a More Efficient or Cleaner Way?

**Answer: Your syntax IS already optimal.**

Here are alternatives with their trade-offs:

**Alternative 1: Chained filters (also good)**
```python
queryset = Prompt.all_objects.filter(
    Q(featured_image__isnull=True) | Q(featured_image='')
).filter(
    deleted_at__isnull=True
)
```
- More readable for complex queries
- Django chains these internally (same SQL)
- Useful when adding filters conditionally

**Alternative 2: Explicit AND in Q object (verbose)**
```python
queryset = Prompt.all_objects.filter(
    (Q(featured_image__isnull=True) | Q(featured_image=''))
    & Q(deleted_at__isnull=True)
)
```
- More explicit about AND operation
- Rarely needed, adds complexity

**Verdict:** Your original syntax is the best choice.

---

### Question 4: Manager Selection - all_objects vs objects

**Answer: You're using the correct manager correctly.**

**Your pattern:**
```python
Prompt.all_objects.filter(
    Q(featured_image__isnull=True) | Q(featured_image=''),
    deleted_at__isnull=True  # Explicit filter
)
```

**This is correct because:**
1. ✅ Uses `all_objects` - Gets all prompts including soft-deleted
2. ✅ Explicitly filters `deleted_at__isnull=True` - Excludes soft-deleted
3. ✅ Gives maximum control for admin dashboards
4. ✅ Clear intent in code (not relying on implicit manager behavior)

**Alternative (simpler but less explicit):**
```python
# This also works but less clear:
Prompt.objects.filter(
    Q(featured_image__isnull=True) | Q(featured_image='')
)
# The objects manager already excludes soft-deleted
```

**Why your approach is better:**
- Explicit is better than implicit (Python zen)
- Makes intent clear: "Show media issues, but not for deleted prompts"
- Easier to understand for future developers
- Easier to modify if requirements change

---

## Practical Verification

### Working Reference Code
Your codebase already has the correct pattern implemented:

**File:** `prompts/views.py`
**Function:** `debug_no_media(request)`

```python
def debug_no_media(request):
    """Debug view to see all prompts without ANY media (no image OR video)."""
    prompts = Prompt.all_objects.filter(
        Q(featured_image__isnull=True) | Q(featured_image=''),
        deleted_at__isnull=True  # ✅ Same pattern you're using
    ).select_related('author').order_by('-created_on')
```

**Your fix matches this exactly.**

### Side-by-Side Comparison

| Aspect | `debug_no_media` (works) | `media_issues_dashboard` (broken) | After your fix |
|--------|----------------------|-------------------------------|----------------|
| Uses `all_objects` | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| Filters Q objects | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| Filters `deleted_at` | ✅ YES | ❌ NO | ✅ YES |
| Shows soft-deleted | ❌ NO | ✅ WRONG | ❌ NO |

## SQL Generated

### Your Fixed Query

```python
Prompt.all_objects.filter(
    Q(featured_image__isnull=True) | Q(featured_image=''),
    deleted_at__isnull=True
)
```

**Generated SQL:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM prompts_prompt
WHERE (featured_image IS NULL OR featured_image = '')
  AND deleted_at IS NULL
```

**Explanation:**
- `WHERE (featured_image IS NULL OR featured_image = '')` - From Q objects
- `AND deleted_at IS NULL` - From the regular parameter
- Result: Only prompts with media issues that aren't soft-deleted

---

## Why This Matters

### The Bug You're Fixing

**Before your fix:**
```
1. Admin deletes a prompt (soft delete)
2. Prompt moved to trash (deleted_at is set)
3. View queries: Prompt.all_objects.filter(Q(...) | Q(...))
4. Problem: deleted_at filter missing
5. Result: Soft-deleted prompt still appears in media issues table
```

**After your fix:**
```
1. Admin deletes a prompt (soft delete)
2. Prompt moved to trash (deleted_at is set)
3. View queries: Prompt.all_objects.filter(Q(...) | Q(...), deleted_at__isnull=True)
4. Fix: deleted_at filter explicitly excludes trash
5. Result: Prompt disappears from media issues, only appears in trash bin
```

---

## Implementation

### The Change (One Line)

**File:** `prompts/views.py`
**Function:** `media_issues_dashboard(request)`

```diff
  no_media = Prompt.all_objects.filter(
      Q(featured_image__isnull=True) | Q(featured_image=''),
+     deleted_at__isnull=True
  )
```

**That's it.** One line fixes both reported issues.

## Django ORM Syntax Rules

For your understanding:

### Rule 1: Q Objects
```python
Q(field1=value1) | Q(field2=value2)  # OR
Q(field1=value1) & Q(field2=value2)  # AND (explicit)
~Q(field1=value1)                    # NOT
```

### Rule 2: Regular Parameters
```python
.filter(field1=value1, field2=value2)  # Implicit AND
```

### Rule 3: Combining
```python
# ✅ Q objects + regular params = implicit AND
.filter(Q(a=1) | Q(b=2), c=3)
# Translates to: (a=1 OR b=2) AND c=3

# ✅ Q objects alone
.filter(Q(a=1) | Q(b=2))
# Translates to: a=1 OR b=2

# ✅ Multiple filter calls = implicit AND
.filter(Q(a=1) | Q(b=2)).filter(c=3)
# Translates to: (a=1 OR b=2) AND c=3
```

## Testing Your Fix

### Unit Test
```python
def test_media_issues_excludes_deleted():
    """Soft-deleted prompts shouldn't appear in media issues"""
    # Create test prompts
    active = Prompt.objects.create(
        title="Active", author=user, status=1, featured_image=None
    )
    deleted = Prompt.objects.create(
        title="Deleted", author=user, status=1, featured_image=None
    )

    # Soft delete one
    deleted.soft_delete(user)

    # Query
    from django.db.models import Q
    no_media = Prompt.all_objects.filter(
        Q(featured_image__isnull=True) | Q(featured_image=''),
        deleted_at__isnull=True
    )

    # Verify
    assert active in no_media       # ✅ Active appears
    assert deleted not in no_media  # ✅ Deleted doesn't
```

### Manual Browser Test
1. Go to Media Issues Dashboard
2. Create prompt without image
3. Verify it appears in the table
4. Delete the prompt
5. Refresh the page
6. Verify it's gone (not in table, but in trash bin)

   - "[Adjective] + [AI Generator] prompts" (cyberpunk Midjourney prompts, fantasy DALL-E, etc.)
   - "Best [AI Generator] prompts for [use case]" (Midjourney prompts for marketing, DALL-E prompts for book covers, etc.)

3. **Emerging Video AI Keywords** represent untapped territory
   - "Sora prompts" / "Sora 2 prompts" (newly searchable, low competition)
   - "Runway prompts" / "Runway Gen-4.5 prompts" (gaining traction)
   - "AI video prompts" (growing search volume)

4. **Broad Category Keywords** for category landing pages

## Competitive Threats & Mitigation

### Threat 1: Large Sites Entering AI Prompt Space
**Risk:** TechCrunch, Forbes, Medium creating prompt guides
**Mitigation:** Specialize in user-generated content (competitors can't do this), build community moat

### Threat 2: AI Generators Building Own Prompt Libraries
**Risk:** Midjourney/DALL-E launch official prompt discovery features
**Mitigation:** Position as independent curator (more trustworthy), stay generator-agnostic

### Threat 3: Search Algorithm Changes
**Risk:** Major Google update reduces organic traffic
**Mitigation:** Diversify traffic sources (email list, social, direct), build brand authority

### Threat 4: New Competitors With Funding
**Risk:** VC-backed competitor launches with huge marketing budget
**Mitigation:** Establish SEO moat early (hard to overtake 12+ months of content), community lock-in

### Threat 5: Shift to AI-Powered Search (ChatGPT, Perplexity)
**Risk:** Users ask ChatGPT for prompts instead of searching
**Mitigation:** Develop ChatGPT plugin, integrate with AI search, position as authoritative source
